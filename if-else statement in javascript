The if...else is a type of conditional statement that will execute a block of code when the condition in the if statement is truthy. If the condition is falsy, then the else block will be executed.

const age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("Nick is an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("Nick is a child.");
}
