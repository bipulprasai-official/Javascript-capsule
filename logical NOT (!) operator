We can modify the example from earlier to use the ! operator to make the boyfriendIsPaying variable  false. Since both conditions are false, the else block would be executed.

const boyfriendIsPaying = true;
const isSale = false;

if (!boyfriendIsPaying || isSale) {
  console.log("Jesse will go shopping.");
} else {
  console.log("Jesse will not go shopping.");
}
