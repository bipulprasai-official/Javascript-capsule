The condition goes before the ? mark and if it is true, then the code between the ? mark and : would execute. If the condition is false, then the code after the  : would execute.
In this example, since age is greater than 18, then the message to the console would be "Can vote".

const age = 32;
const citizen = age >= 18 ? "Can vote" : "Cannot vote";
console.log(citizen);


>>> out put<<<<

Can Vote
