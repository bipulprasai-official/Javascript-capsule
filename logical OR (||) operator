In this example, even though the isSale variable is set to false, the code inside the if block will still execute because the boyfriendIsPaying variable is set to true.

const boyfriendIsPaying = true;
const isSale = false;

if (boyfriendIsPaying || isSale) {
  console.log("Jesse will go shopping.");
} else {
  console.log("Jesse will not go shopping.");
}
