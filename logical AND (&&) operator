In this example, since age is greater than 16 and the ownsCar variable is true, the if block will run. The message printed to the console will be "Jerry is old enough to drive and has his own car."

const age = 17;
const ownsCar = true;

if (age >= 16 && ownsCar) {
  console.log("Jerry is old enough to drive and has his own car.");
} else {
  console.log("Jerry does not drive.");
}
