When the if statement is false, the computer will move onto the else if statement. If that is also false, then it will move onto the else block.
In this example, the else if block would be executed because Alice is between the ages of 18 and 21.

const age = 18;

if (age < 18) {
  console.log("Alice is under 18 years old.");
} else if (age >= 18 && age <= 21) {
  console.log("Alice is between the ages of 18 and 21.");
} else {
  console.log("Alice is over 21 years old.");
}
